Inspired by existing chat programs, he set out to improve the multi-user chat “MultiUser Talk” and thus created Internet Relay Chat, the popularity of which grew immensely within a few years, The term IRC, short for Internet Relay Chat, refers to a chat system that allows people (even strangers) to message each other over the Internet in near real time. IRC users connect to one of numerous networks and then join one or more of the channels. Here you have the option to send text messages to everyone present or to have a private conversation with another person in query mode.
It is important to note that each channel is defined by a specific topic and users also have the option to create their very own channel. Highly frequented IRC chat rooms of the “Libera.Chat” network in 2021 include “#linux” in which users exchange information about the Linux operating system and “#python” which is about the programming language of the same name. IRC is used by both individuals and businesses because it greatly facilitates text-based communication.
